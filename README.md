# SHash

SHash is a hash function that is optimized for the use-cases of competitive programming, and, as far as I'm aware, is the first of its kind.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Though this readme will include some analysis of the "security properties" of this function, such claims should be considered on a purely *experimental* basis. I am not a professional cryptographer. As such, until further notice, avoid using this if your hashmaps might process untrusted input from e.g. a network.
